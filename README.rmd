# Viola-Jones Face Detection Project

This repository is dedicated to my side-hobby project on implementing the Viola-Jones face detection algorithms, as described in the seminal paper by Paul Viola and Michael Jones. I'll be documenting my progress and sharing insights gained throughout the development process.

## Project Overview

The Viola-Jones face detection algorithm is a widely recognized method for real-time object detection. It's known for its efficiency and effectiveness, making it a popular choice in computer vision applications.

## Goals

- **Implementation:** The primary goal of this project is to implement the Viola-Jones face detection algorithms based on the specifications outlined in the original paper.

- **Documentation:** I will be maintaining comprehensive documentation to share insights into the algorithms, implementation details, and any challenges encountered.

## Progress

- [x] Project initialization
- [x] Implement integral image computation
- [x] Implement Haar-like feature extraction
- [ ] Build the cascade classifier
- [ ] Train the classifier on face and non-face data
- [ ] Evaluate and fine-tune the model
- [ ] Document the implementation process
- [ ] Share performance metrics and results

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
