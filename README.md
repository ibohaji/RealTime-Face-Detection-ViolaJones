# Viola-Jones Face Detection Project

This repository is dedicated to my side-hobby project on implementing the Viola-Jones face detection algorithms, as described in the seminal paper by Paul Viola and Michael Jones. I'll be documenting my progress and sharing insights gained throughout the development process.

## Project Overview

The Viola-Jones face detection algorithm is a widely recognized method for real-time object detection. It's known for its efficiency and effectiveness, making it a popular choice in computer vision applications.

## Goals

- **Implementation:** The primary goal of this project is to implement the Viola-Jones face detection algorithms based on the specifications outlined in the original paper.

- **Documentation:** I will be maintaining comprehensive documentation to share insights into the algorithms, implementation details, and any challenges encountered.

## Progress

- [x] Project initialization
This is my first attempt at implemnting research paper into a functioning code, without the use of any major builtin packages.
As I'am doing this project while attending lectures, part-time job and on top of that trying to have some life i will only work on it on    
holidays/ weekends etc.
The main paper i used is the original viola-jones paper, besides this anaylsis of the code that provided pseudocode, which some of them i had       to reimplement and find more optimal soultions for.  
      
- [x] Implement integral image computation'
      Thi
- [x] Implement Haar-like feature extraction
- [ ] Build the cascade classifier
- [ ] Train the classifier on face and non-face data
- [ ] Evaluate and fine-tune the model
- [ ] Document the implementation process
- [ ] Share performance metrics and results

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ibohaji/RealTime-Face-Detection-ViolaJones.git
   cd viola-jones-face-detection
